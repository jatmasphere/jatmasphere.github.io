								  <h4>Locating Grassland Bird Nests with a Drone-mounted Thermal Camera</h4>

									</header>
									<p>During the summer of 2018, I joined a team of recent graduates to conduct a grassland bird nest-searching technique study to assess the efficacy of drones as a survey tool. Technological advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) are an up-and-coming tool that have the potential to improve our ability to locate these hidden nests with minimal intrusion. <span class="image left"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51700497383_afef11e069_c.jpg" width="400" alt="pcciposter"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></span>We compared the effectiveness of locating grassland songbird nests with a thermal camera mounted on a UAV versus the traditional nest searching techniques. We used a paired experimental design to determine whether UAV-assisted searches could replicate the results from traditional search methods. Both methods were highly successful at locating ground nests. UAV-assisted searches located nests 28% faster than traditional methods, but the results from a survival-style analysis indicated that the methods were not significantly different. <br /><br /><br />

								  <h4>Effects of Prescribed Burns on Epigeal Arthropod Communities</h4>
										<p><b><a href="https://calvin.edu/academics/departments-programs/biology/">Calvin University</a></b>, Grand Rapids, MI</p>
									</header>
									<p>In the summer of 2017, I looked at the effect that prescribed burns have on the ground-dwelling arthropod community. Half of the prairie was burned in the spring of 2017, and the other half burned the year prior. Arthropods were sampled with pitfall traps and identified to species. Overall, almost all species were found to have declined in the year following a burn, with the exception of spiders and ants. Collebola, also known as springtails, were found to decline most strongly.<br /><br /><span class="image left"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51718957125_67c74060b4.jpg" width="500" alt="A2AB00AB-8714-4ADB-9BAA-C436B8F33702"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><br />

								  <h4>Effects of Urbanization on Black-capped Chickadees</h4>
										<p><b><a href="https://calvin.edu/academics/departments-programs/biology/">Calvin University</a></b>, Grand Rapids, MI</p>
									</header>
									<p>During my undergraduate education, I participated in a research course looking at how urban landscapes effect fear responses in the Black-capped Chickadee, an urban-dweeling songbird. Chickadees that live near human dwellings must quickly learn how to respond to unfamiliar stimuli, which could alter their fear response to novel circumstances. <span class="image left"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51717280842_ffdcd94755.jpg" width="500" alt="8C988B4D-69F5-4E58-9585-FEF36822FEA5"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br /><br /></p><p>Because exposure to anthropogenic stimuli is more common in birds that inhabit urbanized landscapes, their fear response patterns should more accurately reflect the risks associated with these stimuli. We conducted a series of feeder and playback experiments to explore whether urbanization altered Black-capped Chickadees’ fear responses to model cats, humans, a novel object, and anthropogenic noise. Our results suggest that behavioral plasticity may indicate the ability of a species to thrive in the urban environment.
